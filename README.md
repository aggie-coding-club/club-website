# ACC Club Website
As a team, our project goal is to completely automate the Aggie Coding Club club website so that there will no longer be any need to go into the code manually and change data. Instead, the data for the website is provided from information on the club's Github account and from the club's Google Calendar account.

# Planned Features
- [ ] Pull events from Google Calendar

- [ ] Transfer backend server to Django

- [ ] Provide ACC project signup sheet through the website

- [ ] Use machine learning to assign users to projects

# Instructions

## First-Time Setup (Do this on cloning the repository)
1. Enter the directory where you've cloned the `club-website` repository.
2. Enter the command `virtualenv env`. This creates a virtual environment for your Python libraries, to keep your installations separate from other Python environments.
3. Enter the command `source env/bin/activate`. This activates your virtual environment.
4. Enter the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This installs all of the dependencies listed in the file `requirements.txt`.
5. Done! To deactivate your environment, simply enter `deactivate` into your terminal.

## Returning Setup
1. Enter the directory where you've cloned the `club-website` repository.
2. Enter `source env/bin/activate`. This activates your virtual environment.
3. To deactivate your virtual environment, enter `deactivate`.
