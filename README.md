# Instructions

## First-Time Setup (Do this on cloning the repository)

2. Enter the command `virtualenv env`. This creates a virtual environment for your Python libraries, to keep your installations separate from other Python environments.
3. Enter the command `source env/bin/activate`. This activates your virtual environment.
4. Enter the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This installs all of the dependencies listed in the file `requirements.txt`.
5. Done! To deactivate your environment, simply enter `deactivate` into your terminal.

## Returning Setup
1. Enter the directory where you've cloned the `club-website` repository.
2. Enter `source env/bin/activate`. This activates your virtual environment.
3. To deactivate your virtual environment, enter `deactivate`.
